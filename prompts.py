RECON_PROMPT = "Analyze the provided Solidity contract and summarize the protocol architecture, key modules, and any notable state variables or access controls that could influence vulnerability surface area."
AUDITOR_PROMPT = "Review the raw contract code along with the recon summary, identify any High or Critical logic flaws, and output a clear, specific attack hypothesis explaining the vector, affected functions, and intended impact."
EXPLOIT_DEV_PROMPT = "Using forge-std/Test.sol and Foundry cheatcodes, draft a test contract that demonstrates the attack hypothesis with minimal setup. The test should compile, set up the necessary state, execute the exploit, and include assert statements that prove the vulnerability works."
